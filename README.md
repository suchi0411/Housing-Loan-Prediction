# Housing-Loan-Prediction
# Abstract : Insurance is driven by risk and risk-taking. Risk is generally good, however, the threshold for risk must be calculated. Driven by the need to avoid bad debt, insurance companies tend to make rigorous research on individuals who apply for loans to establish their creditworthiness. This helps the insurance companies avoid bad debt as well as try to indemnify themselves to their best account.
